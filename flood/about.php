Every year floods in Pakistan take thousands of lives,adversely affect millions of lives, leave millions of people homeless and cause properties, infrastructures and  financial losses worth billions of dollars.

            After devastating northwestern Pakistan, floodwaters traveled down the Indus toward the coast in early August 2010. The river overflowed into its floodplain in Punjab and Sindh Provinces as authorities evacuated thousands of residents in Sukkur and other cities. The Christian Science Monitor reported that the floods had affected up to 12 million people, killed more than 1,600 residents, and destroyed or damaged more than 600,000 homes. With monsoon season only halfway over, the floods had already caused more damage than the 2005 earthquake.

            The below List is showing how manay areas affected by  Pakistan  flood 2010 and  showing also 2010 Pakistan floods affected total areas with provinces, districts name  and Indus River . The Indus River has been responsible for all major floods in Pakistan including the floods of 2010, 2011, 2014. In Pakistan there are more than 60 rivers but Indus River is the largest of all. Indus River flows from north to south and collects water from all small and large rivers and finally drops into the Arabian Sea, Karachi, Pakistan. The disastrous flood of 2010 along the Indus River began in July with heavy monsoon rainfall and rapidly affected approximately one-fifth of Pakistan's total land area.

           <p style="text-align:justify;"> 
            The yearly monsoon season in Pakistan started from July 16th 2015. Heavy showers and suspected outburst from glacial lakes along with snow melt from glaciers triggered flash floods and Indus River flooding at multiple locations throughout the country.
             <br>
            Upper areas of province Khyber Pakhtunkhawa mainly district Chitral, were hit severely, causing human loss and massive damages to infrastructure and crops.
             <br>
            Approximately 300,000 people were affected, as ground links to the valleys of Kalash, Garam Chashma, Upper Chitral (Mastuj, Booni, Torkow, Mulkow, Yarkhoon) were cut off. Districts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan were also affected from flooding.
